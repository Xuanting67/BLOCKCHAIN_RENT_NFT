# BLOCKCHAIN_RENT_NFT
this is for Duke Fintech Blockchain Final Project. 
This is non-profit and for educational purpose only. 

You can run the code, nft.py and modify the address of face_parts. 
You can add as many layers as you want. 

In our project, each layers represent different features of renters. 
Features are all randomly assigned.
